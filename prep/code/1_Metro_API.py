This file uses the Metro API to find all the routes and route information from each school in HISD to Hattie Mae White: 

API documentation: https://api-portal.ridemetro.org/api-details#api=53f1db24ee3f340e949f15c7&operation=53f1db25ee3f34058c6da3cc

inputs:

    - school_info.csv (to get the latitudes and longitudes of all the schools)

outputs: 

    - metro_routes.csv

        for each school in school_info.csv, this file has all the routes to HMW 

    - metro_legs.csv 

        for each route in metro_routes, this file has all information for each leg of the trip
