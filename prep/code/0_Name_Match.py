Since the FOIA document from HISD and the TEA documents had different school names, I made this to match the school names properly. 

Notes:
        **** I WENT THROUGH AND MANUALLY EDITED ENTRIES AFTER RUNNING THIS. This matched about 85% of all the entries properly. 
		* Liberty High School has both day and night classes. Both are mapped to the Liberty High School classes
		* "ENERGIZED FOR STEM ACADEMY SOUTHEAST MIDDLE" was not included in the HISD FOIA request

Inputs (from the raw_data folder): 

    - start_end_times.xlsx

        Houston ISD school end times 

    - school_geography.csv

        TEA geographic information 

Outputs (in the int_data folder): 

    - name_match_raw.csv

        preliminary matching of the names
